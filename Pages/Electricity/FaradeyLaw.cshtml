<h1>Faradey law and inductive EMF</h1>
<div class="page-title">
    <p>
        An electromagnetic field (also EM field or EMF) is a classical (i.e. non-quantum) field produced by moving electric charges.
        It is the field described by classical electrodynamics (a classical field theory) and is the classical counterpart to the quantized electromagnetic field tensor in quantum electrodynamics (a quantum field theory). The electromagnetic field propagates at the speed of light (in fact, this field can be identified as light) and interacts with charges and currents.
        Its quantum counterpart is one of the four fundamental forces of nature (the others are gravitation, weak interaction and strong interaction).
