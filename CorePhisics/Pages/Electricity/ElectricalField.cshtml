    <p>
        An electric field (sometimes E-field) is the physical field that surrounds electrically charged particles and exerts force on all other charged particles in the field,
        either attracting or repelling them. It also refers to the physical field for a system of charged particles
        . Electric fields originate from electric charges and time-varying electric currents.
        Electric fields and magnetic fields are both manifestations of the electromagnetic field, one of the four fundamental interactions (also called forces) of nature.
